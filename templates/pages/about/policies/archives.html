<h1>Archives Policy <i class="fas fa-gavel"></i></h1>

<p><em>Last updated: February 6, 2019</em></p>

<p>The PostgreSQL <a href="/list/">mailing lists</a> are archived at
    www.postgresql.org. This site is intended to provide an accurate
    representation of the activity on the lists, and as such will not be
    modified.</p>

<h2>Why won't you remove my post?</h2>

<p>There are a number of reasons why we will not remove or modify messages in
    the archives:</p>

<ul>
    <li>We want the archives to accurately represent the history of our public
        mailing lists.
    </li>
    <li>Messages posted to our mailing lists are archived by other organisations
        outside of our control, as well as in every list subscriber's inbox.
        Removing a message from our archives would only be the tip of the
        iceberg.
    </li>
    <li>Due to the way the archives are stored and occasionally regenerated from
        archived mailbox files, there is no way to permanently modify a message.
    </li>
    <li>We have limited volunteer resources to run the project (and no
        non-volunteer resources) and would prefer to use those resources to
        produce great database management software than to rewrite history.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>E-Mail Disclaimers and Licencing</h2>

<p>Some companies or organization add footers to outgoing e-mail messages with
    that group's e-mail policies, such as this simple example:</p>

<blockquote>This e-mail is confidential and only for use by the intended
    recipient.
</blockquote>

<p>These disclaimers are incompatible with sending messages to the PostgreSQL
    mailing lists. When the mailing list is the "intended recipient", that
    includes all of its current subscribers and the archives. These archives are
    public, archived, and searchable; they cannot be made confidential.</p>

<p>By choosing to send messages to a PostgreSQL mailing list, you are implicitly
    granting your permission for that message to be archived in that fashion,
    regardless of any e-mail disclaimer it might have. Additionally, source code
    submissions to mailing lists such as pgsql-hackers are considered
    submissions to the PostgreSQL project, falling under the project's
    <a href="/about/licence/">PostgreSQL licence</a>. Please make sure you have
    permission to share information with these lists before sending your
    message.</p>
