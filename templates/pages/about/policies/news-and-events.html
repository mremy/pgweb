<h1>News and Events Approval Policy <i class="fas fa-gavel"></i></h1>

<p><em>Last updated: July 26, 2023. {%git_changes_link%}</em></p>

<h2>Policies for Approving News &amp; Events</h2>

<h3>General Rules</h3>

<p>The postgresql.org home page contains News and Events listings which are
    maintained entirely for the benefit of the PostgreSQL community. As this
    space would be quite valuable (up to $400 per listing) if commercially
    available, our admins have unlimited authority to be restrictive about what
    they allow on the home page.</p>

<p>All News and Events (including Training Events) to be approved must include
    the following information:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Accurate contact information</li>
    <li>A descriptive title which distinguishes the item from similar items</li>
    <li>A 10 to 25 word summary of the item which provides enough information
        to clearly let RSS readers know if they want more information.
    </li>
    <li>A description of the news or event which clearly explains what it is
        and how it relates to PostgreSQL.
    </li>
    <li>Links in the description may not use URL shorteners or obfuscators.</li>
    <li>Emoji or other types of special characters may not be used in the title.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other General Rules include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>All items must relate to PostgreSQL in some direct and obvious way.</li>
    <li>Link-only events or news will never be acceptable.</li>
    <li>The web team of the PostgreSQL project may permanently ban any
        organization which is the cause of substantiated complaints about
        accuracy, ethics or legality from members of our community.
    </li>
    <li>The web team makes no promises about timely approval of announcements.
        If publication on a specific day is critical to you, you will need to
        contact the pgsql-www mailing list or a core team member prior to the
        submission.
    </li>
    <li>Companies listed on the sponsors page may be granted an exception to
        any of the limitations on news and events, such as allowed posting
        frequency, at the discretion of the web team.
    </li>
    <li>The web team reserves the right to partially or entirely rewrite News
        or Events postings to improve clarity.
    </li>
    <li>Starting at midnight UTC on the day of a PostgreSQL release, including
        any beta or release candidate (RC), no new announcement request will be
        approved until after midnight UTC 72 hours later. For example, if a new
        version of PostgreSQL is released on 2018-02-08, then no other
        announcements will be approved between 2018-02-08 0:00 UTC and
        2018-02-11 0:00 UTC. Any announcements submitted <em>during</em> this time
        should have their timestamp updated once they are approved, so they
        don't end up looking like old once they do post.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>In general, the postgresql.org home page is run exclusively for the benefit
    of the not-for-profit member-owned PostgreSQL community. It is not an
    advertising venue, and site admins are entitled to reject any notice which
    they feel is inconsistent with the community's needs for any reason, or for
    no reason.</p>

<h2>Approving News and Announcements</h2>

<h3>Proprietary & External OSS Project News</h3>

    based on PostgreSQL, and OSS projects which support PostgreSQL as one of
    several database options.</p>

    acquisitions will be rejected.</p>

<p>In addition, commercial entities who are not financial, in-kind or code
    contributors to the PostgreSQL project will be restricted to one news item
    of any kind per six-month period.</p>

<h2>Approving Events and Event-Related News (excluding training)</h2>

<p>Events must have significant PostgreSQL-related content in order to be
    listed.</p>

<h3>PostgreSQL Conferences & Events</h3>
<p>Any semi-annual or less frequent non-training event which is primarily about
    PostgreSQL or for PostgreSQL users will be entitled to be listed.
    Additionally, conferences which are primarily or entirely about PostgreSQL
    will be entitled to post news items at the following milestones, if they are
    each a week or more apart:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Call for Papers</li>
    <li>Schedule Posting,</li>
    <li>Registration Opening,</li>
    <li>Registration Closing,</li>
    <li>Wrap-up.</li>
</ul>

<p>Routine monthly PostgreSQL User Group meetings will not be listed. First
    meetings of a new PUG can be listed, as well as infrequent major special
    events likely to be of interest outside of the PUG's normal area.</p>

<h3>Open Source & Database Conferences & Events</h3>

<p>Open source conferences, and database conferences, which are not primarily
    about PostgreSQL but have significant PostgreSQL content, such as several
    sessions and a booth, may be listed in the Events. Additionally, the Call
    For Papers for these events may be accepted as News.</p>

<p>More routine events, such as monthly local meetings or mini-conferences, will
    not be listed. Conferences must have significant PostgreSQL content to be
    worth listing, with decisions on relative significance to be made by the web
    team.</p>

<h2>Training Events</h2>

<p>PostgreSQL Training may be listed from any company, under the following
    conditions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Each listing must include:
        <ul>
            <li>Specific locations and dates for that specific training</li>
            <li>Link to online training registration</li>
            <li>One or more sentence description of the contents of that
                specific training
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>All descriptive text should be purely informative and not include strong
    marketing copy or special offers unrelated to the training. The vendors
    website should list PostgreSQL training information, including an online
    schedule of upcoming trainings.</p>

<p>In the event that any training company submits more than 4 training events to
    be held in any given quarter, site admins may (at their discretion) deny
    posting events to that company.</p>
