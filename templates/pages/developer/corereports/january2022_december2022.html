<h1>Core Team Report: January 2022 - December 2022<i class="fas fa-comments"></i></h1>

<p>
  This is a high level report of the activities of the
  <a href="/developer/core">PostgreSQL Core Team</a> during the period of
  January 2022 to December 2022. While we aim for full transparency, some
  activities may be kept confidential for privacy and other reasons.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Code of Conduct and Code of Conduct Committee</strong></p>
    <p>
      The PostgreSQL Core Team accepted changes to the Code of Conduct to
      clarify
      <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=pgweb.git;a=commitdiff;h=76ea6e51d7e74e93f82b93630e10da51906e1a4d;hp=de0364bf011eae2eecf74075ab8e3be6c6a7e608">
        term limits</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>War in Ukraine and its impact to the PostgreSQL project</strong></p>
    <p>
      The Core Team handled several different situations that were related to
      the war in Ukraine and its impact to the project.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Time Zone Database changes</strong></p>
    <p>
      PostgreSQL includes a copy of the Time Zone Database (tzdata) to ensure
      that PostgreSQL will work on systems that do not include tzdata. In 2022,
      there were changes in the Time Zone Database (tzdata) that would affect
      the display of historical timestamps and different options on how to
      maintain backwards compatibility. Based on an evaluation of what major
      operating systems were doing, the Core Team opted to continue shipping the
      standard tzdata build.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Trademark management and disputes</strong></p>
    <p>
      The Core Team delegates trademark management to the
      <a href="https://www.postgres.ca/">PostgreSQL Community Association of Canada</a>
      (PGCAC). The Core Team was made aware of several ongoing trademark
      disputes that PGCAC and, in some cases,
      <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/">PostgreSQL Europe</a> (PGEU) are
      engaged in. These disputes are ongoing as of the writing of this report.
